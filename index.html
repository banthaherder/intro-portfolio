                I've had an interest in coding ever since 8th grade when I saved up and bought my first laptop, an Avertec 3200, off craigslist for ~$100. As cool as it was, it was too slow to play most games and our dial-up internet made web browsing painful. Looking for something to use my laptop for I ended up installing 'QB64'. I learned to <strong>PRINT</strong> text, take and verify user input with <strong>INPUT</strong> and <strong>IF</strong>, and preform loops with <strong>GOTO</strong> and <strong>DO</strong>. I put my skills to use by editing the browser application links to run a program which would require a password before opening the actual browser. After graduating high school I attended Oregon State University for 2 years; however, I found the financial burden to be too high and the curriculum content and methods to be dated. I returned to the Portland area and picked up two full-time jobs in order to afford living expenses, payback student loans, and be able to save money for later use. In the spring of 2017 I purchased a computer off craigslist from some guy. The topic of web development came up and he told me about how his brother-in-law and cousin completed code bootcamps and landed good jobs. I heavily researched the different code schools in Portland and ended up choosing <strong>Epicodus</strong>.
