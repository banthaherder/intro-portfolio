                I've had an interest in coding ever since I saved up and bought my first laptop, an Avertec 3200, off craigslist when I was in middle school. It was too slow to play most games and our dial-up internet made web browsing painful. Looking for something to use my laptop for I ended up installing 'QB64'. I learned to <strong>PRINT</strong> text, take and verify user input with <strong>INPUT</strong> and <strong>IF</strong>, and preform loops with <strong>GOTO</strong> and <strong>DO</strong>. I put my skills to use by editing the browser application links to run a program which would require a password before opening the actual browser. After graduating high school, I attended Oregon State University for 2 years; however, I found the financial cost to be too high and the curriculum content and style to be dated. I returned to the Portland area and picked up two jobs in order to afford living expenses, payback student loans, and to be able to set money aside. In the spring of 2017 I purchased a computer off craigslist. The topic of web development came up and he told me about how his brother-in-law and cousin completed bootcamps and landed good jobs. I heavily researched the different code schools in Portland and ended up choosing <strong>Epicodus</strong>.
